IMPORTANT: SETTING UP YOUR PAPAL NEWS MONITOR BOT
==================================================

I've detected an issue with your Telegram bot configuration. Follow these steps to fix it:

1. OPEN TELEGRAM AND START YOUR BOT:
   - Search for "@pope_pump_bot" in Telegram
   - Start a chat with your bot
   - Send any message (e.g., "/start" or "hello")
   
   This is crucial because Telegram bots can only send messages to users who have started a 
   conversation with them first.

2. GET YOUR CORRECT CHAT ID:
   - Search for "@userinfobot" in Telegram
   - Start a chat and send any message
   - It will reply with your user ID (e.g., "Your id: 123456789")
   
3. UPDATE YOUR .ENV FILE:
   - Edit the .env file: nano .env
   - Update the TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS value with your actual chat ID
   - Save and exit: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X

4. TEST THE BOT AGAIN:
   - Run: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3.8 test_telegram.py
   - You should receive a test message in Telegram

5. RUN THE FULL BOT:
   - Once the test is successful, run:
   - /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3.8 papal_news_monitor.py

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The bot is using Python 3.8, not your default Python environment
- Always use the full path to Python 3.8 to run the scripts
- If you want to run this on Render.com, you'll need to update your environment variables there

Good luck! Your bot should work properly after completing these steps.
